- installation of a package can be done with 3 ways, lets take an example of nodemon package.
  1. npm install nodemon --save
    It will indicate that the package will use as production dependency where we really use it in
    and need it.
  2. npm install nodemon --save-dev
    It indicate that we are using dependency just as a developer for development.
  3. npm install nodemon -g
    It indicates that we are installing packages globally, meaning throughout our machine
    just like we install node.js. As other ways of installing is local, meaning it will only
    get installed over a project.
  4. npm install nodemon
    It is a default way of installing a package when we don't really know how are we gonna use
    the package.
- once you install it, the name and the version of the package will also be mentioned in
  package.json file.
- after installing it will also create node_modules folder and package-lock.json file.
    a. node_modules:
      - It will contain whole built code of the package along with their own package.json file
        with other dependencies the package need.
      - If you want to share the code to somewhere else then you can delete node_modules folder,
        as you can reinstall it on any machine with "npm install" command.
    b. package-lock.json:
      It will contain the exact precise version of packages.
- the arrow mark beside the verion of package in package.json indicates that whenever you are
  going to install the packages for the application with "npm install" command, at that time
  it states that the package might have a newer version currently, so check before installing
  and also install it if necessary.
