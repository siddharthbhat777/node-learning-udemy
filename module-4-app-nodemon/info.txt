1. 'package.json' is a file which keeps all the information of your application.
2. It contains data in key-value pair, where all the keys must be in double inverted commas("").
3. You can also edit it.
4. The key 'script' mainly states a common command which will run your app and the developer won't
   need to guess which is the entry file.
5. In that if you mention "start" as your keyword, then you can run the application in 2 ways:
    a. npm start
    b. npm run start
   It is because 'start' is a default npm keyword to start an application.
6. On the other hand if you put any arbitary keyword of your choice e.g. siddharth-start,
   then the command "npm siddharth-start" will be invalid.
   Then you can only use command i.e. "npm run siddharth-start".
