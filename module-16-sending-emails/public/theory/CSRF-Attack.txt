How does CSRFÂ work?
1. So, first user mistakenly visit a fake website that lokks exactly like our site.
2. then user sends request to that fake page and that page redirect that user to the original page along with the malicious stuffs with the redirection link.
3. after that, the kind of a post request is sent which generates response which user did not expected.

How to avoid it?
1. Make a kind of condition with which user can only use a session if they are working with your views.
2. such thing will not allow fake pages to interact with our website.
